## Usage

### 1. Dataset Preparation

#### In-distribution dataset

Please download [ImageNet-1k](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index) and place the training data and validation data in
`./datasets/id_data/ILSVRC-2012/train` and  `./datasets/id_data/ILSVRC-2012/val`, respectively.

#### Out-of-distribution dataset

We have curated 4 OOD datasets from 
[iNaturalist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06642.pdf), 
[SUN](https://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2010/SUN/paper.pdf), 
[Places](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/PAMI_places.pdf), 
and [Textures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.3618.pdf), 
and de-duplicated concepts overlapped with ImageNet-1k.

For iNaturalist, SUN, and Places, we have sampled 10,000 images from the selected concepts for each dataset,
which can be download via the following links:
```bash
wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangrui/imagenet_ood_dataset/iNaturalist.tar.gz
wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangrui/imagenet_ood_dataset/SUN.tar.gz
wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangrui/imagenet_ood_dataset/Places.tar.gz
```

For Textures, we use the entire dataset, which can be downloaded from their
[original website](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/).

Please put all downloaded OOD datasets into `./datasets/ood_data/`.

### 2. Pre-trained Model Preparation

The model we used in the paper is the pre-trained ResNet-50 and MobileNet-v2 provided by Pytorch. The download process
will start upon running.

### 3. OOD Detection Evaluation

To reproduce our results on ResNet-50, please run:
```
sh feat_compute.sh
```
for extract the feature vectors and :
'''
python ood_test.py
'''
